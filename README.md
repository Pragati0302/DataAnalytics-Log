# My Data Analysis Learning Journey

Hi! I'm Pragati, and this repo is my personal space to document my learnings and projects in Data Analysis. My goal is to master foundational and advanced analytical techniques, build a strong project portfolio, and track my progress over time.

This isn't a polished portfolio yet. It's a work-in-progress journal of what I'm learning, where I'm stuck, and how I'm growing.

##  Why I'm Doing This

I aim to establish a solid foundation in data analysis, apply what I learn, track my progress, and ultimately transition into more advanced roles. This repo helps me stay accountable, reflect on what I’ve learned, and share it with others who might be on a similar path.

## My Learning Path

I'm tackling the Data Analyst toolkit in phases. The current focus is entirely on foundational programming and database querying. This is how I've planned to master it.

1. ✅ Python Basics (functions, loops, recursion)
2. ✅ SQL Fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.)
3. 🔜 Coding Practice (GfG 160 Days)
4. 🔜 Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
5. 🔜 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6. 🔜 Real-world Projects (Kaggle, UCI datasets)
7. 🔜 Resume-ready Portfolio

## Resources I'm Using
I am currently using these resources to refresh my knowledge. I’ll keep adding resources as I go deeper into this journey

### 🔹 Python
- [GeeksforGeeks Python Skill-Up Track](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/skill-up-python/)
- [W3Schools] https://www.w3schools.com/python/
- YT Tutorial by Telusko

### 🔹 SQL
- [Codecademy SQL Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql/) 
- [SQL Playground](https://buddysql.seancoughlin.me/lessons) 

### 🔹 Coding Practice (Coming Soon)
My initiative to build a habit of daily coding. 
I'll drop the problems I struggle with most here for future reference.
